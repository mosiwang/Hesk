<h2>HESK</h2>

This repository is home to (what will hopefully be) a collection of various tweaks and modifications to HESK v2.5.3.

<h2>Branches</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>master:</strong> this branch will always be empty, as it is used as a the base version of HESK. All modifications will branch off of master, so every tweak starts fresh.</li>
<li><strong>hesk-ui:</strong> this branch contains the files changed to "create" the HESK UI look and feel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Download/Install a Tweak</h2>

Please refer to each individual branch's README to learn how to download/install/configure the tweak.
